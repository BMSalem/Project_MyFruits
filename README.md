# 🍎 MyFruits – Intelligent Mobile Fruit Classification App

MyFruits is an intelligent mobile application that leverages Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to automatically identify fruits from images and provide nutritional information along with recipe suggestions.

This project was developed as part of a Final Year Project (PFA) in the Computer Engineering & Networks program.

## 🚀 Key Features

📷 Fruit Identification :
- Capture images using the device camera
- Import images from the gallery
- Real-time fruit classification using a CNN model

🥗 Nutritional Information :
- Calories
- Vitamins
- Minerals

🍽️ Recipe Suggestions :
- Recipes related to the identified fruit
- Ingredients and preparation steps

🔐 User Authentication :
- Secure sign-up and sign-in using Firebase

⚙️ Permissions Management :
- Controlled access to camera and gallery

## 🧠 Artificial Intelligence
- Model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Trained for fruit image classification
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
- Model developed using TensorFlow / Keras
- Converted for mobile deployment (TensorFlow Lite)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 Mobile Development
- Flutter (Dart) – Cross-platform mobile development
